### CCSNe Waveform Model Analysis

This directory contains the necessary Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts to load and analyze CCSNe waveform models, both matter and neutrino-sourced. 
The provided tools allows one to:

- Plot the [original & tapered] matter + neutrino strain waveforms against various GW detector noise curves.
- Reproduce Figures 1 and 2 from: [arXiv:2405.13211].
- Generate Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) tables for the analyzed models, as seen in [arXiv:2405.13211].
