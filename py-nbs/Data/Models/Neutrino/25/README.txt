### CCSNe Neutrino GW Model

For the 25 solar mass progenitor GW Neutrino model:

- Repo: https://www.astro.princeton.edu/~burrows/gw.3d.2024.update/ 
- Parameters: 
  - (t, hp*D, hx*D)
  - **Units:** 
    Time (t) is in seconds.
    hp and hx represent the respective polarizations (in cm) for the strain viewed along a respective direction.
    D denotes the source distance.

**Notes:** 
(a) To obtain the strain, divide by the source distance (D); e.g., 1 kpc = 3.086e21 cm.
