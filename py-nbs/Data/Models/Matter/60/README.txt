### CCSNe Matter GW Model

For the 60 solar mass progenitor GW matter model:

- **Waveform Data:** (https://dvartany.github.io/data/)
- **Model Specifications:**
  - **Parameters:** (t, hp*D, hx*D)
  - **Units:** Time is in seconds; hp and hx represent the respective polarizations (in cm) for the strain viewed along the equatorial plane. D denotes the source distance.
  - **Reference:** For further details, refer to [Vartanyan et al. 2023, Table I](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023PhRvD.107j3015V/).

**Notes:** 
(a) To obtain the strain, divide by the source distance; e.g., 10 kpc = 3.086e22 cm.
